# Python

Working repository for learning and practicing Python, focused on offensive security, automation, and tooling.

## Layout

- `black-hat-python/` – Code and experiments from working through *Black Hat Python* plus my own variants.
- `python-101/` – Basic Python exercises, notes, and practice scripts (fundamentals, control flow, data structures, etc.).
- `exercises/` – Small focused challenges and drill-style scripts (e.g., parsing, small tools, practice problems).
- `junk/` – Scratchpad code, throwaway experiments, quick tests. Nothing here has to be pretty.
- `tests/` – Test scripts or validation code for tools I actually care about.

This repo is intentionally messy and for personal use. Anything polished that’s worth showing to others will be promoted into my **Portfolio** repo.
